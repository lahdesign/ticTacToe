I. Overview
A tic tac toe game for visual learners. The game features 2 object constructor functions and is suggested for users beginning to understand their usage. The design is minimal & the board responsive. 
I am working towards using alpha channels to mimic overprinting, as if you were playing the game with markers in a notebook.

II. Technologies Used
      - JavaScript
      - HTML
      - CSS

III.Features/ Additions
      - Constructor functions
      - Responsive Design
      - Displays imagery, which will be improved upon to have a handdrawn look
      - Code written in a way where I can explain it visually to someone, 
        want to improve the play game portion to be more visual

IV. Process of building
      - Thought of the game like a pinball machine
      - Began writing the function names I would need
      - Started defining universal variables and how their states would change
      - Ended up refactoring my code to be more object oriented
      - Redrew my entity relationship diagram
      - Realized I had an array that was smarter than I knew what to do with
V. Updates


an object constructor function to build new users 
-an object constructor function to initilize the board
+**How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS?**
 

+I will use moon imagery and feature a very clean and responsive design
+I would like to use alpha channels to mimic overprinting, as if you were playing the game with markers in a notebook
