+**data structure**
+The playing area (or board) is divided up into square cells. I will refer to a cell by its row and column. 0, 0 will be the point of origin and be in the upper-left corner of the board &  2, 2 will be the lower-right corner. I will name positions using an array. Each click will be collected and logged as either a move by X or O
+
+**How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS?**
I thought of the game like a pinball machine. 

Universal Variables
-Count
PlayerXTurn

Personal Goal 
to work with object Constructors:
+an object constructor function to build new users 
+an object constructor function to initilize the board

<br>
+**How you plan to approach this project**
+with fear. and hopefully a good plan.
+
+**user stories**
+collecting user information (new and returning)
+playing the game
+announcing Winner
+a button to enter a new game
+
+
+**modular code plan**
+A file layout system that is modular. 
+
+**creative spin**
+I will use moon imagery and feature a very clean and responsive design
+I would like to use alpha channels to mimic overprinting, as if you were playing the game with markers in a notebook
